Project Setup Description:

To set up the project, begin by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

1. Open your project directory and run `npm install` to fetch and install all the required dependencies. This command will scan the project's package.json file and download the necessary packages from the npm registry.

Once the installation process completes successfully, you'll have all the dependencies needed to run the project.

2. After installing the dependencies, execute `npm start` in the terminal. This command initiates the project and launches it on port 3000.

Once the project starts running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. This is the default URL where the project will be served locally.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully set up the project, installed its dependencies, and started it on port 3000. Now you can begin working on your project and explore its functionalities.

Project Overview:

The project utilizes several libraries to enhance its functionality and provide a seamless user experience. The key libraries employed in this project are MUI, Styled Components, TypeScript, and React Router.These libraries contribute to building a modern, scalable, and user-friendly project.

The project is built upon React Router. It incorporates multiple pages, including a Home page, Pokemon page for displaying individual Pokemon details, and an Error page to handle situations where fetch requests fail or unsupported URLs are accessed.

The Home page serves as the landing page of the application, providing an overview or introduction to the project. Users can navigate to different sections of the application, including the Pokemon page, from the Home page.

The Pokemon page is designed to display detailed information about a specific Pokemon. It leverages the data fetched from an external API or a local data source to populate the page with relevant details, such as the Pokemon's name, image, type, abilities, and other characteristics. Users can explore various Pokemon by accessing their respective pages through dynamic routing.

To handle potential errors, such as failed fetch requests or accessing unsupported URLs, the project incorporates an Error page. This page acts as a fallback route and gracefully handles unexpected scenarios. It may display an error message, a friendly notification, or suggest alternative actions to the users, helping them navigate back to a valid section of the application.

Features:

The project incorporates a bookmark feature for Pokemon cards, allowing users to save their favorite cards for quick access later. Users can mark specific Pokemon cards as bookmarks, enabling them to easily revisit those cards without searching for them again.

Furthermore, the project provides a powerful search functionality for finding Pokemon based on three parameters: from A to Z, from Z to A, and the default search. Users can choose their preferred sorting order and retrieve the corresponding Pokemon results accordingly. This feature enhances the user experience by providing flexible search options.

To handle a large number of Pokemon cards, the landing page and search results utilize functional pagination. This means that the cards are divided into multiple pages, and users can navigate through the pages to view more Pokemon cards. This approach improves performance and provides a more organized browsing experience.

In cases where the searched Pokemon are not found or do not match the specified criteria, the project incorporates an error component. This component displays a user-friendly message or notification, informing users that no matching Pokemon were found. It allows users to adjust their search parameters or try again with different criteria.

When a user clicks the "More" button on a Pokemon card, it triggers navigation to the Pokemon details page. This page provides comprehensive information about the selected Pokemon, including its name, image, type, abilities, and other relevant details. Users can explore additional details and characteristics of the Pokemon on this page.

Lastly, the project includes an error page that users can access in case of any unexpected errors or when navigating to unsupported URLs. This error page provides a navigational link to return to the initial state of the application, resetting the app to its default settings. It ensures a smooth and error-tolerant user experience by gracefully handling any unforeseen errors.

By combining the bookmark feature, flexible search parameters, functional pagination, error handling components, and Pokemon details page, the project offers a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for exploring, bookmarking, and learning about Pokemon cards. It aims to provide an engaging and intuitive experience for Pokemon enthusiasts.
